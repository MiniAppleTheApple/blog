# Introduction

I am MiniApple, from Rio de Janeiro. I am a Chinese-Brazilian who likes to code, play chess, and play instruments.
# Programming

I started coding when I was 12, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Like everyone else, I was stuck at home and very bored, so I began my programming journey. I like to call myself an "unemployed programmer." I mainly use Elixir, JavaScript, and Go for my projects. These languages have different shortcomings, which can offset each other.
# Chess

I started playing chess at 14 years old, thanks to my mom. She isn't a chess player, but during one of her trips, she took my laptop with her. Without my laptop for almost a month, I decided to find a new interest. I chose chess because it looked complicated and I thought it would take a long time to master. It turns out, its complexity means I can study it for my entire life.

# Playing Instruments

I began learning to play an instrument at age 15 and chose the bass, inspired by "Bocchi the Rock!" I actually forgot the exact reason why I chose the bass, but I don't rule out the possibility that it's because I like two bassists from the anime: Ryo Yamada and Kikuri Hiroi. Besides this reason, maybe I just like the deep sound of the bass, but I'm not sure when I started paying attention to it. As expected, many people thought it was a guitar; few people know this instrument. Shortly after, my mom suggested I learn another instrument, so I chose the piano. Its versatility is vast, suitable to learn music theory, and with a keyboard (electric piano), I can switch its sound to mimic other instruments.
